Transcript-Grounded Question Answering from YouTube Videos
📌 Overview

AskTube AI is an LLM-powered question-answering system that allows users to ask natural language questions about a YouTube video and receive answers strictly grounded in the video’s transcript.

The system:

Fetches YouTube captions

Splits and embeds the transcript

Stores embeddings in a vector database

Retrieves only relevant context

Forces the LLM to answer only from the transcript

Returns “I don’t know” if the answer is not present

This prevents hallucination and keeps answers verifiable.

🧠 Why this project matters

Most LLM demos answer anything — even when the source doesn’t contain the answer.

This project:

Enforces source-grounded answering

Demonstrates RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)

Uses local LLMs (Ollama) instead of paid APIs

Is directly applicable to education, research, and interviews
